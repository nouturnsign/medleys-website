                  <div class="accordion-body">Anything you'd like! We love all types of music and welcome pieces of all genres and languages. The bottom line is that we want you to sing something that you are comfortable with and that you feel showcases your talent best. The one rule that we have is that your selection MUST be without accompaniment (sorry, no instruments or backing tracks of any kind). There will be a keyboard available to supply your starting pitch. Since we will only listen to about one minute of your solo audition piece, we recommend that you choose an excerpt that immediately shows your vocal strength without any long introductions or instrumental breaks.</div>

                  <div class="accordion-body">Definitely not! Medleys makes selections based on those we feel have the greatest potential to contribute to the group. In years past we have taken students with years of musical and vocal training as well as students who have never sung in a group or played an instrument before in their lives. If we feel that a candidate has the potential to be a benefit to the group, we will consider taking them regardless of their experience or training.</div>

                  <div class="accordion-body">Since we want to keep our group at a manageable size for travel, each year we usually have 12-16 members. The number of positions we are looking to fill fluctuates each year with our graduates, but we are usually looking for at least one person for each vocal part. That being said, we do not have a particular quota of spots to fill, and if we find someone who we feel is a good match for our group, we will accept them regardless of the number of "available spaces."</div>

The potential members who are called back will be emailed excerpts of sheet music which they will be responsible for learning before coming to callbacks. During callbacks, they will be asked to learn group warm-ups and will be given the chance to interact and sing with current group members (as well as other potential members) in small groups. In total, you should plan for callbacks to take 2-3 hours.
